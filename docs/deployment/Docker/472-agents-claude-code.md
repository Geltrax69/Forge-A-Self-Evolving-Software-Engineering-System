Official documentation: [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs)

## [Quick start](#quick-start)

Launch Claude Code in a sandbox by pointing it at a project directory:

```console
$ sbx run claude ~/my-project
```

The workspace parameter defaults to the current directory, so `sbx run claude` from inside your project works too. To start Claude with a specific prompt:

```console
$ sbx run claude --name my-sandbox -- "Add error handling to the login function"
```

Everything after `--` is passed directly to Claude Code. You can also pipe in a prompt from a file with `-- "$(cat prompt.txt)"`.

## [Authentication](#authentication)

Claude Code requires either an Anthropic API key or a Claude subscription.

**API key**: Store your key using [stored secrets](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/security/credentials/#stored-secrets):

```console
$ sbx secret set -g anthropic
```

Alternatively, export the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in your shell before running the sandbox. See [Credentials](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/security/credentials/) for details on both methods.

**Claude subscription**: If no API key is set, Claude Code prompts you to authenticate interactively using OAuth. The proxy handles the OAuth flow, so credentials aren't stored inside the sandbox.

## [Configuration](#configuration)

Sandboxes don't pick up user-level configuration from your host, such as `~/.claude`. Only project-level configuration in the working directory is available inside the sandbox. See [Why doesn't the sandbox use my user-level agent configuration?](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/faq/#why-doesnt-the-sandbox-use-my-user-level-agent-configuration) for workarounds.

### [Default startup command](#default-startup-command)

Without extra args, the sandbox runs:

```text
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Arguments after `--` are added after the default flags when the first one is itself a flag (begins with `-`), so `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is preserved:

```console
$ sbx run claude -- -c   # runs claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -c
```

When the first argument is a bare word, such as the `agents` subcommand, it replaces the defaults instead.

See the [Claude Code CLI reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference) for available options.

## [Agents view](#agents-view)

Claude Code's [agents view](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-view) dispatches tasks to subagents that work in parallel, each in its own Git worktree. Pair it with [clone mode](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/usage/#clone-mode) for an isolated multi-agent workflow:

```console
$ sbx run --clone claude -- agents
```

This invocation replaces the [default startup command](#default-startup-command), so it doesn't include `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and you can't switch to bypass-permissions mode inside the sandbox. To work around this, either use Claude Code's auto mode or pass the flag explicitly:

```console
$ sbx run --clone claude -- --dangerously-skip-permissions agents
```

The subagents' worktrees live inside the sandbox's private clone — none of them touches your host repository. Each subagent commits to its own branch, and you review the work from the host by fetching the `sandbox-<sandbox-name>` remote:

```console
$ git fetch sandbox-<sandbox-name>
$ git diff main..sandbox-<sandbox-name>/<branch>
```

See [Git workflow](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/usage/#git-workflow) for clone-mode details.

## [Base image](#base-image)

The sandbox uses `docker/sandbox-templates:claude-code`. See [Templates](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/customize/templates/) to build your own image on top of this base.

## [Use a local model](#use-a-local-model)

To run Claude Code in a sandbox against a local model on your host through Docker Model Runner, see [Run Claude Code in a Docker Sandbox with Docker Model Runner](/guides/claude-code-sandbox-model-runner/). For the host-only version without a sandbox, see [Use Claude Code with Docker Model Runner](/guides/claude-code-model-runner/).
