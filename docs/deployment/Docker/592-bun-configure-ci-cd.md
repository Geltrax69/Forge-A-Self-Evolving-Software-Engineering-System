## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

Complete all the previous sections of this guide, starting with [Containerize a Bun application](https://docs.docker.com/guides/bun/containerize/). You must have a [GitHub](https://github.com/signup) account and a verified [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/signup) account to complete this section.

   ```console
   $ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

7. Run the following commands to stage, commit, and push your local repository to GitHub.

   ```console
   $ git add -A
   $ git commit -m "my commit"
   $ git push -u origin main
   ```

## [Step two: Set up the workflow](#step-two-set-up-the-workflow)

Set up your GitHub Actions workflow for building, testing, and pushing the image to Docker Hub.

1. Go to your repository on GitHub and then select the **Actions** tab.

2. Select **set up a workflow yourself**.

   This takes you to a page for creating a new GitHub actions workflow file in your repository, under `.github/workflows/main.yml` by default.

3. In the editor window, copy and paste the following YAML configuration and commit the changes.

   ```yaml
   name: ci

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Login to Docker Hub
           uses: docker/login-action@v4
           with:
             username: ${{ vars.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
             password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

         - name: Set up Docker Buildx
           uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v4

         - name: Build and push
           uses: docker/build-push-action@v7
           with:
             platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
             push: true
             tags: ${{ vars.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/${{ github.event.repository.name }}:latest
   ```
