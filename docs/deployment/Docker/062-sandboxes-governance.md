# Governance

Table of contents

***

Sandbox governance covers the policy system that controls what sandboxes can access over the network and on the filesystem. It operates at two layers, and only one applies at a time:

**Local policy** is configured per machine using the `sbx policy` CLI. It lets individual developers customize which domains their sandboxes can reach. See [Local policy](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/governance/local/).

**Organization policy** is configured centrally in the Docker Admin Console or via the [Governance API](/reference/api/ai-governance/). Rules defined at the org level apply uniformly across every sandbox in the organization. When organization governance is active, it replaces local policy entirely: local `sbx policy` rules are no longer evaluated. See [Organization policy](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/governance/org/).

Alongside this access-control policy, admins can require developers to sign in as members of their organization before using sandboxes at all. [Sign-in enforcement](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/governance/sign-in-enforcement/) is deployed through endpoint management and ensures developers can't bypass organization policy by using a personal account.
