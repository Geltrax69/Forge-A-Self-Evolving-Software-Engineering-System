# Containerize a Python application

***

Table of contents

***

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

* You have installed the latest version of [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).

## [Overview](#overview)

Containerizing your application means packaging it together with its dependencies, configuration, and runtime into a single portable unit called a container image. Running that image creates a container, an isolated process that behaves the same on any machine, whether it's your laptop, a CI runner, or a production server.

In this section, you'll containerize a simple [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) web application. You'll write a `Dockerfile` that describes how to build the image, add a `compose.yaml` file that defines how Docker runs your container, and then build and start the application with one command.

You'll use [Docker Hardened Images](/dhi/) as the base. These are minimal, secure Python images maintained by Docker.

## [Create the application](#create-the-application)

The sample application is a minimal FastAPI service with a single endpoint that returns a JSON greeting. Create the following files in a new `python-docker-example` directory. To create all the files at once, switch to the **Scaffold script** tab in the file browser and copy the shell command.

python-docker-example

```python
# A minimal FastAPI application.
# The root endpoint (GET /) returns a JSON "Hello World" response.
# See https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/ for the framework reference.

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}
```

```text
# Python package dependencies for the application, pinned for reproducible builds.
# See https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/

fastapi==0.115.12
uvicorn==0.34.3

If you already have Python installed and want to verify the app works before containerizing it, you can run it locally:

```console
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ uvicorn app:app --reload
```

> Note
>
> On Windows, activate the virtual environment with `.venv\Scripts\activate` instead of `source .venv/bin/activate`.

If you don't have Python installed, skip ahead to the next section. The remaining steps run the application in a container, with no local Python required.

## [Create the Docker assets](#create-the-docker-assets)

Sign in to the DHI registry so Docker can pull the Python base images during the build. The available Python images are listed in the [catalog](https://hub.docker.com/hardened-images/catalog/dhi/python).

```console
$ docker login dhi.io
```

Add the following three files to your `python-docker-example` directory. The `Dockerfile` describes how to build the image, `compose.yaml` defines how Docker runs the container, and `.dockerignore` keeps unwanted files out of the build context.

> Tip
>
> [Gordon](/ai/gordon/), Docker's AI assistant, can generate Docker assets for your project. Ask Gordon to create a Dockerfile, Compose file, and `.dockerignore` tailored to your application.

To learn more about each file, see the following:

* [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/)
* [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#dockerignore-file)
* [compose.yaml](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/)

## [Run the application](#run-the-application)

Inside the `python-docker-example` directory, run the following command in a terminal.

```console
$ docker compose up --build
```

Open a browser and view the application at <http://localhost:8000>. You should see a simple FastAPI application.

In the terminal, press `ctrl`+`c` to stop the application.

### [Run the application in the background](#run-the-application-in-the-background)

You can run the application detached from the terminal by adding the `-d` option. Inside the `python-docker-example` directory, run the following command in a terminal.

```console
$ docker compose up --build -d
```

Open a browser and view the application at <http://localhost:8000>.

To see the OpenAPI docs you can go to <http://localhost:8000/docs>.

You should see a simple FastAPI application.

In the terminal, run the following command to stop the application.

```console
$ docker compose down
```

For more information about Compose commands, see the [Compose CLI reference](/reference/cli/docker/compose/).

## [Summary](#summary)

In this section, you learned how you can containerize and run your Python application using Docker.
