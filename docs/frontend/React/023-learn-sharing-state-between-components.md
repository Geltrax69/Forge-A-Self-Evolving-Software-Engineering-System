```
import { useState } from 'react';

function Panel({ title, children }) {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}>
          Show
        </button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}

export default function Accordion() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel title="About">
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology">
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}
```

```
const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
```

And instead, add `isActive` to the `Panel`’s list of props:

```
function Panel({ title, children, isActive }) {
```

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Accordion() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel title="About" isActive={true}>
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology" isActive={true}>
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}

function Panel({ title, children, isActive }) {
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}>
          Show
        </button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}
```

Try editing the hardcoded `isActive` values in the `Accordion` component and see the result on the screen.

### Step 3: Add state to the common parent[](#step-3-add-state-to-the-common-parent "Link for Step 3: Add state to the common parent ")

Lifting state up often changes the nature of what you’re storing as state.

In this case, only one panel should be active at a time. This means that the `Accordion` common parent component needs to keep track of *which* panel is the active one. Instead of a `boolean` value, it could use a number as the index of the active `Panel` for the state variable:

```
const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);
```

When the `activeIndex` is `0`, the first panel is active, and when it’s `1`, it’s the second one.

Clicking the “Show” button in either `Panel` needs to change the active index in `Accordion`. A `Panel` can’t set the `activeIndex` state directly because it’s defined inside the `Accordion`. The `Accordion` component needs to *explicitly allow* the `Panel` component to change its state by [passing an event handler down as a prop](/learn/responding-to-events#passing-event-handlers-as-props):

```
<>

  <Panel

    isActive={activeIndex === 0}

    onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}

  >

    ...

  </Panel>

  <Panel

    isActive={activeIndex === 1}

    onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}

  >

    ...

  </Panel>

</>
```

The `<button>` inside the `Panel` will now use the `onShow` prop as its click event handler:

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Accordion() {
  const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel
        title="About"
        isActive={activeIndex === 0}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}
      >
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel
        title="Etymology"
        isActive={activeIndex === 1}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}
      >
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}

function Panel({
  title,
  children,
  isActive,
  onShow
}) {
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={onShow}>
          Show
        </button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}
```

```
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function SyncedInputs() {
  return (
    <>
      <Input label="First input" />
      <Input label="Second input" />
    </>
  );
}

function Input({ label }) {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  function handleChange(e) {
    setText(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <label>
      {label}
      {' '}
      <input
        value={text}
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
    </label>
  );
}
```
